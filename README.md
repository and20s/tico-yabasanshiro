*Part of the Tico ecosystem* — https://www.ticoverse.com

**YabaSanshiro** is a Sega Saturn emulator, known for its hardware-accelerated renderers and its speed on modest hardware.

This port is exclusive to Tico, adapted to work with its frontend and runtime, and provided as a standalone build for the Nintendo Switch. It focuses on integration, consistency, and predictable behavior within the Tico ecosystem.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Vulkan is heavier than OpenGL.** It needs an overclocked Switch to run at full speed. OpenGL is the default and the lighter renderer.

----------

## Summary

This port focuses on making YabaSanshiro fit naturally within Tico, rather than behaving as a separate application.

It adds:

-   Custom overlay matching Tico design, including time, date, user avatar, and game title
-   A renderer choice in one build: OpenGL (devkitPro's Mesa, the lighter one) or Vulkan (NVK), which is heavier and needs an overclocked Switch to run at full speed
-   AMD FSR 1.0 upscaling with either renderer, and with Vulkan frame generation (LSFG, with your own Lossless.dll)
-   Button mapping, and the multitap for up to 8 players
-   Explicit control over display (integer scaling and aspect ratios)
-   Built-in save and load state support, with pictures, that remembers the disc of multi-disc games
-   Cartridges, a choice between the real and emulated BIOS, and skipping the BIOS intro
-   Integrated RetroAchievements with custom alerts

## A Note

A lot of work in this scene disappears over time — not because it lacked value, but because it was never shared.
If you are building something, consider releasing it. Even small contributions can help others move forward.
